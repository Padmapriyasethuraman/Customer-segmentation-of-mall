K-means Clustering of Mall Customers

 Overview

This Python script performs K-means clustering on a dataset of mall customers to segment them based on annual income and spending score. It uses `scikit-learn` for clustering and `seaborn` with `matplotlib` for visualization.

Requirements

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

Dataset

The script requires the dataset `Mall_Customers.csv` with the following columns:

- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

 Usage

1. Place the `Mall_Customers.csv` file in the same directory as the script or adjust the `file_path` variable accordingly.
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

3. The script will generate a scatter plot of the clusters.
